# ðŸ“Š Educational Animations for Data Operations

This project generates educational animations that visually explain various data operations in Python. The app leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 model to generate Python code for Manim, a powerful animation engine. These animations simplify complex data manipulation concepts, making them easier to understand.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Generate Animations:** Automatically generate animations that explain different data operations using Manim.
- **Visualize Data Operations:** Includes topics like column selection, data filtering, grouping, aggregation, joining, and advanced reshaping.
- **Download Options:** Users can download the animations in both MP4 and GIF formats.
- **Interactive Interface:** The app is built with Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for selecting topics and generating videos.
